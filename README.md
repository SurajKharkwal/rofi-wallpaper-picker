## ⚙️ Configuration

If you prefer to store the configuration elsewhere, update the following variables inside **`set-wallpaper.sh`**:

- `WALLPAPER_DIR` — Path to your wallpaper directory.  
- `IMAGE_PICKER_CONFIG` — Path to your `image-picker.razi` configuration file.

If you use a different wallpaper manager (e.g., **feh**, **swww**, **nitrogen**, **hyprpaper**, etc.), modify the **last `if` block** in `set-wallpaper.sh` accordingly.
